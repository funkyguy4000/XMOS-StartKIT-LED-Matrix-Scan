XMOS-StartKIT-Programs
======================

Just a simple repo to hold all of the basic programs for the  XMOS startKIT.  Unfortunately I did not have time to work with this too much so I have not been able to revisit this to add more projects.  Much of my development has moved to ARM as it is more industry standard than XMOS controllers.

If there are any issues with this content, please let me kno!
